# curiosities

This repository contains short programs and investigations into curious problems.

It is partially inspired by Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).

### Languages

So far, everything is in Python 3. Several of the solutions are proofs using the [Z3 Theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). To run these, first install Z3 via `pip3 install z3-solver` or by following the instructions on that page.
