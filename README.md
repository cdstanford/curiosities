# curiosities

This repository contains short programs and investigations into curious problems.

It is partially inspired by Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).

### Languages

Most solutions are written in Python 3 or Rust.
Some are proofs using the [Z3 Theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3);
to run these, first install Z3 via `pip3 install z3-solver` or by following the instructions on that page.
There is also an [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/) solution.
