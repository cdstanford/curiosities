# curiosities

This repository contains short programs and investigations into curious problems.

It is partially inspired by Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).

### Languages

Most solutions are written in Python 3. Some of these are proofs using the [Z3 Theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). To run these, first install Z3 via `pip3 install z3-solver` or by following the instructions on that page.

Besides Python 3, some solutions are in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/).
