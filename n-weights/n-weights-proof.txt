The minimum value is N = 6.

If N is 4 or less, order the weights a < b < c < d. Then c + d can't be the sum of any remaining values, as the remaining sum is at most a + b. So this is impossible.

If N is 5, order the weights a < b < c < d < e. Considering d + e, we find
d + e = a + b + c
On the other hand, considering a + b, we find a + b = c, d, or e. So
d + e = (b, c, or d) + c <= d + c.
But this is impossible as e > c.

For N = 6, the following set of weights works (and is probably the simplest):
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
