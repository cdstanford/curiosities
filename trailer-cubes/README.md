# Trailer cube puzzle

See `trailer_cube_puzzle.jpg`.
I did this puzzle in my [ECS 189C class](https://github.com/DavisPL/189C), Winter 2026.

The small spoiler is that this is a "rage bate" image (I downloaded it off the
internet, after all) and several different answers are possible
(even for the minimum and maximum number of possible cubes),
depending on what assumptions are made.
You can view `trailer_cube_solution.py` for a solution using Z3,
and `spoiler.md` for a bigger spoiler (specific possible answers).
