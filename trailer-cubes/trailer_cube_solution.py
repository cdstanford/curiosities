Trailer cube puzzle

Let's use Z3 to find out & resolve this question.

=== Trailer cube puzzle ===

How many cubes are in the trailer?

A small spoiler:
The answer may depend on which assumptions are made.

i.e. for this particular set of assumptions
- assuming gravity is present -
the minimum number of cubes happens to be 31.

Exercises:

1. What is the minimum number of cubes if we do NOT assume gravity?

2. What is minimum number of cubes if we assume that gravity is present, but we also have access to "glue" which allows us to glue the cubes to each other? That is, we can put the cubes wherever we want, but they have to be glued to a sequence of cubes which eventually touches the ground.

3. Can you think of any other assumptions under which we will get a different answer than all of the above?
